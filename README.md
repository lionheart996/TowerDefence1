Welcome to my first Tower Defence game, built using Pygame. This project has been an incredible learning journey, and I am excited to share what I have accomplished and learned through the development process.

Features
Basic Gameplay Mechanics: Implemented the core mechanics of a tower defence game, including enemy spawning, turret placement, and upgrading.
User Interface: Created a functional and interactive user interface with buttons for starting levels, buying and upgrading turrets, and fast-forwarding the game.
Enemy Waves: Designed a system to spawn enemies in waves, including different enemy types with varying strengths.
Turret Functionality: Developed turrets with multiple upgrade levels and the ability to attack enemies.
Game States: Managed various game states such as game over, level completion, and win/loss conditions.

What I Learned

1. Pygame Fundamentals

Initialization and Setup: Learned how to initialize Pygame, create a game window, and manage the game loop.
Rendering: Understood the process of drawing images, text, and shapes on the screen using Pygame's rendering functions.
Event Handling: Mastered handling different types of events, such as mouse clicks and quitting the game.

2. Game Logic and State Management
   
State Management: Implemented logic to handle different game states, ensuring smooth transitions between playing, game over, and victory screens.
Updating Game Entities: Learned to update the state of game entities (enemies and turrets) each frame to reflect changes in game logic.

4. Working with Sprites and Groups
   
Sprites and Groups: Utilized Pygame's sprite classes to manage and update game entities efficiently.
Collisions and Interactions: Developed interactions between turrets and enemies using sprite groups and collision detection.

5. Loading and Using Assets
   
Images and Sounds: Learned to load and manage various assets, including images for the map, turrets, enemies, and GUI elements, as well as sound effects.
Fonts and Text Rendering: Used Pygame's font module to render text for displaying game information.

6. Custom Classes and Modular Design
   
Class Design: Created custom classes for different game components such as Enemy, Turret, World, and Button to keep the code organized and modular.
JSON Data Handling: Parsed level data from JSON files to dynamically load game levels and enemy waves.

8. Debugging and Optimization
   
Debugging Techniques: Gained experience in debugging Pygame applications, identifying and fixing issues related to game logic, rendering, and performance.
Performance Optimization: Implemented optimizations to ensure the game runs smoothly, even with multiple enemies and turrets on screen.
